# So you want to be a topcoder?

#### What is this about?
How to start competing at [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com) and similar websites,
The knowledge of [algorithms](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/the-importance-of-algorithms/) you should have to be proficient at it, events and
IRL competitions, competitors you should follow.
